# SAAS Template
My SAAS (Software as a service) Template is designed around quickly setting up the boilerplate of every web based software I create. It includes an array of components like navigation bars, authentication protected pages, FAQ sections, dynamic user forms, pricing cards, and much more. It also includes tooling for quick and secure authentication, database calls, and mobile responsivness.

### Why I built it
I found myself repeadily re-coding the same parts of my SAAS projects over and over again. I wanted a way to focus on the core functionality of the project and not the boilerplate. I would also find myself reinventing new and better ways to code parts of my program that would then create inconsistancies across all of my projects. One highly customizable template was the solution to both of those problems. And here we are.

### Code privacy
For the sake of protecting the source code, I have decided to keep it private. I've put a lot of work into this project and it could be valued at a lot of money. As the basis of all my business ventures creating software, I stand firm in this decision. For inquires, contact me.
